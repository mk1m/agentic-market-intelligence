# agentic-market-intelligence
An autonomous, end-to-end financial analysis system that combines Real-time ETL, Predictive Machine Learning, and Agentic AI to provide technical insights on any stock ticker.

## Core Features
- Universal Ticker Support: Dynamically handles any stock or crypto ticker (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, BTC-USD) via high-frequency data extraction.
- Self-Healing ML Pipeline: Features a "Just-in-Time" XGBoost trainer. If a model for a specific ticker does not exist, the system automatically triggers a training cycle before the agent analyzes the data.
- High-Performance ETL: Built with Polars for lightning-fast data transformations and feature engineering (Lags, Volatility, Moving Averages).
- Dockerized Architecture: Fully containerized environment ensuring "it works on my machine" reliability, with persistent storage for models and data.
- Agentic Financial Mentor: An LLM-powered agent (Llama 3 via Ollama) that interprets complex statistical forecasts into plain-English, mentor-style analogies.

## Project Architecture
The system follows a modular "Chain of Intelligence" design:

- Extraction: Fetches historical data using yfinance.
- Transformation: Polars processes raw data into stationarity-adjusted features.
- Loading: Data is synchronized with a SQLite database for long-term context.
- Forecasting: A ticker-specific XGBoost Regressor predicts price movement.
- Reasoning: The Agent pulls the latest DB context + ML prediction and generates a report.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Data Science: Polars, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning: XGBoost, Joblib
- Database: SQLite3
- AI/LLM: Ollama (Llama 3)
- DevOps: Docker, Docker Compose

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running.
- Ollama installed and running on your host machine.

### Installation & Execution
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mk1m/agentic-market-intelligence.git
cd agentic-market-intelligence
```

Launch the System:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Interact: When prompted in the terminal, enter a ticker (e.g., NVDA). The system will handle the data, training, and analysis automatically.

## Future Roadmap

While the core logic is complete, the following features could be future work:

* **Web Interface (Streamlit/React):** Transition from a CLI to a web dashboard with interactive charts and real-time ticker searching.
* **Multi-Model Voting:** Implement an ensemble approach where multiple models (XGBoost, LSTM, and Prophet) vote on a price direction to increase forecast reliability.
* **Cloud Orchestration:** Deploy the containerized architecture.

## Disclaimer
This is a personal project developed for educational and portfolio purposes only. * Not Financial Advice: The predictions and reports generated by this agent are based on historical data and statistical models. 

Accuracy: LLMs and ML models can "hallucinate" or provide inaccurate forecasts. Use this tool as a technical experiment, not a trading signal.
